## Logging level can be debug, info, warn or error

## Format dictates the format of entries in the logfile.  The Python
## logging documentation should be consulted if you want to change this.

## As with the logging format above, this controls the format of the date
## field within log entries.

## An email contact address that should reach the gateway operator.
