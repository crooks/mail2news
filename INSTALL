The following command will install the mail2news program:-

	python setup.py install

This will need to be run by a user with write permissions to the Python
dist-packages directory. In most cases this will be root.  See the MANIFEST
file for a list of the files that will be installed.

After installation, the gateway is ready for testing.  Login with a system
account you plan to use for running the gateway.  Ideally, create one
specifically for the job.  Run mail2news as that user and the required
directory structure will be created under the homedir/mail2news along with
some default configuration files.

Next you need to customize the gateway's configuration to suit your
environment.  Copy the mail2newsrc file to ~/.mail2newsrc and modify it as
required.  Each option is preceeded with a short explanation and the default
value is shown.  Don't forget to uncomment the associated section header if you
uncomment an option within it!

Once everything is working to your satisfaction, you'll need to configure your
MTA (or Procmail) to pass messages to the gateway.


That's it, you're done!
